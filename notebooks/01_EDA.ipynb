    "- Mirror of Year Built (Age = 2025 - Year Built)\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "All scatter plots confirm complete independence between property characteristics and price. The price appears to be randomly assigned rather than determined by property features. This makes the dataset unsuitable for learning real-world pricing patterns, but acceptable for demonstrating ML pipeline implementation."
